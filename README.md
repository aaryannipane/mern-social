# Social Media Web App

This is a social media web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app allows users to share images, follow and unfollow other users, like and comment on posts, and engage in real-time chat using Socket.io. The app also leverages Cloudinary for image storage.

## Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out securely. User passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.

2. **User Profile**: Each user has a profile with a profile picture, username, and bio.

3. **Image Sharing**: Users can post images with captions, which are stored on Cloudinary. Images can be uploaded and displayed.

4. **Follow and Unfollow**: Users can follow and unfollow other users to see their posts in their feed.

5. **Like on Posts**: Users can like and unlike posts. The number of likes is updated in real-time.

6. **Real-time Chat**: Users can engage in real-time chat with other online users using Socket.io.

## Future Development

The following features are planned for future development:

1. **User Settings**: Users will be able to update their profile information, including their profile picture.

2. **User Search**: Users will be able to search for other users using a search bar.

3. **Comment System**: Users will be able to comment on posts.

4. **Infinite Scroll**: Implement infinite scrolling for better user experience.

5. **Image Optimization**: Optimize images further by implementing techniques like lazy loading and only displaying visible images.
